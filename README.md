# **Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch** ü§ñ

A comprehensive collection of machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch in Python for educational purposes. This repository aims to provide clear, well-documented implementations to help understand the inner workings of fundamental ML algorithms.

### üéØ Purpose

This project serves multiple purposes:


- Deep understanding of machine learning algorithms by implementing them from first principles
- Educational resource for others learning ML
- Reference implementation for common ML algorithms
- Practice ground for Python programming and ML concepts

### ‚úÖ Implemented Algorithms

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Naive Bayes
- XGBoost
- Multi-layer Perceptron Regressor
- Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier


### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

This repo is a work in progress! Star the repository to stay updated with new implementations.
