# **Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch** ü§ñ

A comprehensive collection of machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch in Python for educational purposes. This repository aims to provide clear, well-documented implementations to help understand the inner workings of fundamental ML algorithms.

### üéØ Purpose

This project serves multiple purposes:


- Deep understanding of machine learning algorithms by implementing them from first principles
- Educational resource for others learning ML
- Reference implementation for common ML algorithms
- Practice ground for Python programming and ML concepts


Each implementation includes:

- Detailed mathematical explanations
- Step-by-step implementation walkthrough
- Example usage and test cases
- Performance comparisons with sklearn implementations
