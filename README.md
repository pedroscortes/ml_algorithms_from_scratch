# **Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch** ðŸ¤–

A comprehensive collection of machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch in Python for educational purposes. This repository aims to provide clear, well-documented implementations to help understand the inner workings of fundamental ML algorithms.

### ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This project serves multiple purposes:


- Deep understanding of machine learning algorithms by implementing them from first principles
- Educational resource for others learning ML
- Reference implementation for common ML algorithms
- Practice ground for Python programming and ML concepts
